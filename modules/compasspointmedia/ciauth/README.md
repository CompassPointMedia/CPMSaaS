I have previously set up a package at Packagist.org compasspointmedia/julietmenu, but I am setting up this "Module" in CodeIgniter 4 to experiment as to what's minimally necessary to have a self-contained module - and then bring it over to packagist.  In theory it should run just as well in a root modules folder as a root vendor folder.
